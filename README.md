# React-Play-Nine

A game of Play Nine implemented using ReactJS. ([Live Demo](http://codepen.io/kevlai22/pen/BQzbjY?editors=0010))

When the game starts, you get a random number of stars between 1 and 9 and you have the set of numbers in the bottom frame that you can use. You can select one or more numbers that would sum up to the value of the random stars. The objective is to use all the numbers in the bottom frame. If you end up with a number of stars that has no possible correct combination then you get to redraw and you can do that five times. After that, if you still end up with a number of stars that has no possible correct combination out of all the remaining numbers, then you lose the game.
